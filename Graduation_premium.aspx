						<p class="style6">&nbsp;&nbsp; Graduation plays a 
						critical role in shaping one’s professional career. 
						After completing graduation, you are supposed to have 
						superior knowledge in a particular stream of education. 
						Graduation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
						provides a base that you can utilize to realize your 
						dreams. While many students find a right way to fulfill 
						their dreams, a majority of them find it difficult to 
						choose the right career option after graduation. The 
						confusion in choosing right career option is natural. 
						You have numerous career options after graduation like 
						Management, Hospitality, Computer, Information 
						Technology etc. Many of them didn’t even exist a few 
						years ago. Therefore, you may need to seek guidance and 
						support from experienced counselors in choosing the best 
						career after graduation.&nbsp;If you are not liking your 
						subject, job or stream of education and want a change – 
						Don’t get frustrated. Feel happy about the fact that you 
						have realized your potential and looking to improve your 
						life. Feel confident and read what all options exist 
						after graduation.&nbsp;If you need expert assistance in 
						deciding right career option for you ..</p>
						<p class="style6"><strong class="style7">Career After Graduation</strong></p>
						<p class="style6">Before you choose the best career after graduation, 
						you need to know growth prospects, competition, 
						availability of jobs, work requirements, etc. of that 
						field.&nbsp;Remember that all salary brackets given here are 
						mainly for freshers. The figures are approximate, and 
						the actual salary depends on several factors. If you are 
						good in English Language or Mathematics, you may tend to 
						get better salaries than rest. Communication skills make 
						a remarkable difference in overall career development 
						irrespective of nature of work. Additionally, if you are 
						good in basic calculations and Mathematics, it will help 
						in arriving at right decisions. Here is a list of 
						options that will give a good start.</p>
						<p class="style9">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><strong>Sales and Business Development</strong></em></p>
						<p class="style6">Sales and Business development is an evergreen 
						career. It will never go out of fashion. In the era of 
						high competition, the demand for business development 
						professionals will only increase. Every company, 
						irrespective of its size and strength, requires sales 
						professionals. Business Development Roles in 
						FMCG/IT/Manufacturing companies are one the most sought 
						after profiles in top B-Schools. Many companies hire 
						graduates for entry level sales profiles. If you are 
						good at interacting with people, you will love this job. 
						Business development profile is also a mini 
						entrepreneurial role. You can control your salary, 
						incentive and career progression. No office politics can 
						stop you from growing to the pinnacle of your career if 
						you get business for the company. If you ever dream of 
						becoming an entrepreneur and starting your own business, 
						this kind of role will give a huge boost.</p>
						<p class="style6">Startups, eCommerce, and smaller IT firms hire fresh 
						graduates for business development executive and 
						pre-sales roles. The earnings of entry level sales 
						professionals can start with INR 10,000 per month and 
						can go up to 30,000 per month depending on personality 
						and fluency in the language.</p>
						<p class="style6">
						&nbsp;</p>
						<p class="style10"><strong><em>Marketing/Advertising/Communication</em></strong></p>
						<p class="style6">If you are one of those who believe sales and 
						marketing are the same things, please do some research 
						before applying for next marketing executive role. 
						Marketing positions are mainly office jobs. You do 
						research, analysis, conceptualize and implement 
						marketing campaigns, develop strategies, etc. Again this 
						job is most sought after in B-Schools placements. Since 
						this role requires strategic thinking, companies prefer 
						to hire MBAs. However, if you have graduated from a 
						reputed college, you may get an opportunity. Smaller 
						companies who can’t afford MBAs hire fresh graduates and 
						train them for their specific roles. You must have 
						excellent communication and analytical skills to excel 
						in this field.&nbsp; Limited number of marketing roles 
						in an Organization makes this area intensely 
						competitive. Depending on your college, and employer, 
						fresh graduates get a salary in the range of INR 
						15,000-30,000 per month.</p>
						<p class="style6">
						&nbsp;</p>
						<p class="style10"><strong><em>Management</em></strong></p>
						<p class="style6">Everyone is doing MBA so it must be good. Right? 
						Wrong! MBA is no more a lucrative career option if you 
						have done it from a 2nd or 3rd tier college. People do 
						MBA for better campus placements. Placement records of 
						two and three tier colleges have been pathetic in last 
						few years. Most of the MBA graduates are unemployable. 
						The worst thing comes when you pay INR 10lakh+ to do MBA 
						and remain unemployed after completing the course.</p>
						<p class="style6">So does that mean one one should not do MBA? No, this 
						is an extreme conclusion. You must prepare well for MBA 
						entrance exams like CAT/FMA/IIFT/SNAP/XAT/MAT etc. and 
						get into a decent college. If unluckily you can’t get 
						into a decent college then work hard on your 
						communication skills, aptitude and get practical 
						exposure while doing MBA. If done well from a reputed 
						college, you may be eligible to do almost any 
						non-technical job available in the economy. You can work 
						in sales &amp; marketing, HR, Banking, Financial services, 
						FMCG, Operations, IT, Manufacturing and any other 
						business functions or sectors. On an average MBA 
						graduates get a salary in the range of INR 25,000 to INR 
						1,00,000.</p>
						<p class="style6">
						&nbsp;</p>
						<p class="style10"><strong><em>CS/CA/CFA/CWA:</em></strong></p>
						<p class="style6">If you have done your graduation in commerce stream 
						then you will naturally go for any of these: Company 
						Secretary (CS), Chartered Accountant (CA), Chartered 
						Financial Analyst (CFA), or Costs and Works professional 
						(CWA). Demand for these professionals is always high in 
						any economy. Before choosing a particular course, you 
						must know the difference between these disciplines and 
						what kind of jobs you will be doing after completing 
						them successfully.&nbsp; If you are a commerce graduate, 
						you can also go for MBA in Finance to develop a career 
						opportunity in Corporate Finance and Mergers and 
						Acquisitions. The salary depends on the discipline and 
						communications skills of applicants. However, salaries 
						of most of the professionals in these fields start at 
						INR 40,000 per month.</p>
						<p class="style6">
						&nbsp;</p>
						<p class="style12"><strong><em>I<span class="style13">T Degree/Courses: MCA/Animation/Web Design</span></em></strong></p>
						<p class="style6">IT courses are not restricted to just science 
						graduates. Anyone can learn a programming language or 
						can work in IT after doing a professional certificate 
						course or a degree course like MCA. If you have done 
						your graduation in non-mathematics stream (like BA 
						etc.), then you may need to do a short introductory 
						course to be eligible to get into MCA. For example, if 
						you have done Bachelor of Arts and want to pursue MCA 
						from IGNOU, then you need to pass a six-month 
						certification program known as CIC.</p>
						<p class="style6">We are living in a technology era so a certificate or 
						degree course in IT will open up a vast career 
						opportunities. You may work as a computer operator, 
						software professional, site developer, web designer, 
						animator, logo designer, software developer and more. 
						You can even start your own business and earn a decent 
						revenue from month one. You can get a starting salary of 
						INR 10,000 to INR 50,000 depending on your skill set, 
						college, communication skills and technical expertise.</p>
						<p class="style6">
						&nbsp;</p>
						<p class="style6">
						&nbsp;</p>
						<p class="style14">
						&nbsp;</p>
						<p class="style10"><strong><em>Mass Communication and Journalism:</em></strong></p>
						<p class="style6">Digital media has opened up a lot of career 
						opportunities for mass communication professionals. With 
						experience, you may become correspondent, reporter, 
						anchor, columnist, editor and radio jockey. You can even 
						start your publishing website and monetize it. You can 
						easily earn Rs 15,000 to Rs 50,000 per month either by 
						working as independent media professional or joining a 
						media company.</p>
						<p class="style16"><strong>Hotel Management:</strong></p>
						<p class="style6">Hotel Management provides an excellent opportunity to 
						work with well-known brands in various roles. Post 
						graduation in Hotel Management will help you getting a 
						decent job through campus placement. After graduating in 
						Hotel management, you can also work in catering 
						services, Food technology startups, restaurants, 
						Railways, shipping, corporate organizations, clubs, etc. 
						You can expect a starting salary of INR 10,000 to INR 
						35,000.</p>
						<p class="style16"><strong>Travel and Tourism:</strong></p>
						<p class="style6">If traveling the world excites you, you can join this 
						industry. You will get an opportunity to discover the 
						world and interact with several cultures. There are 
						plenty of job opportunities in this area. After doing a 
						professional certificate or degree course in Tours and 
						Travel, you can also start your own business. You can 
						expect a salary of INR 15000 to INR 30,000 per month at 
						the beginning of your career.</p>
						<p class="style6">
						    &nbsp;</p>
						<p class="style6"><strong class="style7">Civil Aviation: Air Hostess/Commercial Pilot:</strong></p>
						<p class="style6">Commercial pilots and air hostess are dream job 
						profile for many. However, due to the limited 
						requirement of such roles, you will find intense 
						competition in this field. Commercial pilots get a 
						starting salary of INR 1,50,000+ per month while Air 
						Hostesses get INR 50,000+ per month.</p>
						<p class="style16"><strong>Social Sector:</strong></p>
						<p class="style6">If your happiness is directly related to the 
						happiness of needy people around you, social sector is a 
						good career option. The best part is today we have 
						highly professional NGOs who not only deliver their 
						services as efficiently as their corporate counterparts 
						but also have a well-planned career progression for its 
						employees. You can expect a relatively lower salary than 
						corporate world however the feeling of making others 
						smile because of your efforts is priceless.&nbsp; You 
						can even start your own NGO in a particular field to 
						help others.</p>
						<p class="style6">
						    &nbsp;</p>
						<p class="style16"><strong>Law:</strong></p>
						<p class="style6">The law is a highly competitive and evergreen field. 
						You need to do LLB/LLM to become a practicing lawyer. 
						After completing your LLB/LLM, you may also prepare for 
						judicial services exams or join corporate legal firms. 
						Graduates from top institutes also prefer to join LPOs 
						(Legal Process Outsourcing) as it provides a lucrative 
						career opportunity, high compensation, and faster 
						growth.&nbsp;The compensation for fresh law graduates falls 
						in the range of INR 10,000 – 40,000 per month.</p>
						<p class="style6">
						&nbsp;</p>
						<p class="style16"><strong>Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance:</strong></p>
						<p class="style6">BFSI sector (Banking, Financial Services, and 
						Insurance) has employed millions of Indians. The 
						industry is witnessing an unprecedented growth and 
						expected to grow in the same fashion in future. If you 
						want to work in Public sector banks, you need to pass 
						entrance tests like SSC and Bank PO exams. ICICI Bank 
						also conducts entrance exams for recruitment of 
						probationary officers.</p>
						<p class="style6">Sales people constitute 80 percent of the employees 
						in insurance companies. They hire a large number of 
						fresh graduates as entry level sales executives. You may 
						find it difficult to handle sales pressure initially. 
						However, it becomes a stable and regular job in 2-3 
						years down the time. With experience, you will also 
						learn how to deal with such pressures.</p>
						<p class="style6">In the banking sector, you can expect an initial 
						salary of INR 15,000 to INR 35,000 per month, where as 
						in insurance and financial services industries the 
						salary range could be INR 10,000 – 25,000 per month.</p>
						<p class="style16"><strong>Library Science:</strong></p>
						<p class="style6">Library Science is a multidisciplinary field that 
						includes practices and tools of management, information 
						technology, education and several other areas. You need 
						to have a relevant degree in Library science to be 
						employed in school or college libraries, public and 
						private libraries, and museums, etc. The salary ranges 
						from INR 15,000 to 30,000 per month.</p>
						<p class="style16"><strong>Teaching/Education:</strong></p>
						<p class="style6">In India, education is considered to be a noble and 
						prestigious profession. While education sector attracts 
						everyone equally, females seem to be more inclined 
						towards this profession. To develop a formal career in 
						teaching in schools, you need to complete 
						B.Ed./Teachers’ Training program. For teaching in 
						Colleges and universities or equivalent, you should have 
						a post graduate degree and clear NET. In many cases, 
						graduates join private colleges as guest faculty or on 
						contract and pursue their post graduation and prepare 
						for NET along with their contractual jobs.</p>
						<p class="style6">Many professionals prefer to work in the booming 
						coaching industry. Coaching institutes pay better than 
						their school or college counterparts and require no 
						B.Ed. or NET. They also have well-planned career 
						progression in place for people who are seriously 
						looking to build a career in the coaching industry.&nbsp;The 
						salary in the education sector can vary from INR 15,000 
						to 1,00,000 lakh depending on your education credentials 
						and field.</p>
						<p class="style10"><strong><em>Public Sector – Defense and Police Jobs/Civil 
						Services/Forest Services/Railway Jobs</em></strong></p>
						<p class="style6">You need to appear for entrance exams conducted by 
						various government institutions to get into the Public 
						sector. Exams like Civil Services, NDA, IES, SSC are 
						some of the prominent ones that you need to pass for 
						selection in respective department.</p>
						<p class="style10"><strong><em>Film and TV: Acting/Direction/Production</em></strong></p>
						<p class="style6">If you want to get into Film and television industry, 
						you need to try for some courses in related fields. You 
						can also try your luck for National School of Drama 
						which is the biggest institute for theater training in 
						India. Alternatively, you can start your channel on 
						YouTube to showcase your talent to the online audience. 
						If you are creative and talented, you will see your 
						channel growing with the help of a little digital 
						marketing efforts. Many YouTube stars are doing better 
						than established film and television actors.</p>
						<p class="style10"><strong><em>Modelling</em></strong></p>
						<p class="style6">You don’t need any educational qualification to get 
						into modeling profession. Like other areas, starting 
						early will benefit you in the long run. However, if you 
						intend to do modeling, you should start preparing for it 
						seriously. It is advised that you should continue your 
						education/job while preparing for modeling. Having a 
						stable income and career will help you pass through that 
						struggle period relatively easier. Along with required 
						style, body figure, etc. you must know the art of 
						networking. Talent alone will not help much.&nbsp; Also 
						while picking up the first assignment, you shouldn’t pay 
						much attention to the fee you are offered.</p>
						<p class="style16"><strong>Beauty care</strong></p>
						<p class="style6">If you wish to become Hair stylist, beauty therapist, 
						massager, make-up artists, etc. then do the courses for 
						the relevant field. Earning is very high depending upon 
						the quality of work and customer satisfaction.</p>
						<p class="style16"><strong>Medical Transcription</strong></p>
						<p class="style6">Medical transcription refers to converting 
						voice-recorded reports into text formats. So when a 
						physician consults her patients, it will be recorded and 
						converted into text format for later use. After the 
						short training course, you can work in Medical 
						Transcription. You can start earning anything between 
						INR 10,000 to 30,000.</p>
						<p class="style16"><strong>BPO/KPO</strong></p>
						<p class="style6">BPO/KPO sector can accommodate fresh graduates from 
						any stream. If you are good in English language, then 
						you can earn a handsome salary in BPOs. However, many 
						feel that the growth opportunities are limited in BPO 
						sector. Also, the shift timings (night shifts) may not 
						be suitable for everyone. If you need a corporate 
						experience and at the same time willing to earn a decent 
						income, you may prefer work in BPO sector. However, if 
						you are serious about your career and have long term 
						perspective avoid this area. KPO Sector is more of 
						knowledge based industry and better than BPO. However, 
						until you are graduated from a top college, you may not 
						be eligible for KPO companies.<br />
						Pay Scale – The packages for domestic BPOs start at INR 
						8,000 per month while the salary for international BPOs 
						ranges from INR 15,000 to 40,000 per month.</p>
						<p class="style16"><strong>Content/Technical writing</strong></p>
						<p class="style6">The Internet is all about content. From news to 
						social media to youtube videos, there is a writer behind 
						everything you see on net. The content may be written in 
						the form or news, social media post for business pages, 
						video script, blog, website content, product 
						description, brochure, advertising copy, user guides or 
						business agreement. Every article you read on internet 
						would be been either written by a content writer or 
						proofread by an editor. All companies be it small or 
						large need professional writers for their content 
						development requirement. Writers are paid handsomely for 
						their good work. You can write in English, Hindi or any 
						other regional languages you are good in. The salary of 
						full time content writer can be anything from INR 
						15,000-35,000 per month.</p>
						<p class="style6">
						    &nbsp;</p>
						<p class="style16"><strong>Entrepreneurship</strong></p>
						<p class="style6">Nothing is better than Entrepreneurship if you have 
						ability to take risks. You will either succeed or learn 
						great lessons that no job or course will teach you. Many 
						people think of first gaining a work experience or doing 
						MBA and then starting a business so that they will have 
						a better understanding of business management. However, 
						lack of knowledge of business functions and overall 
						management will not hold you because whatever is taught 
						in MBA is available on internet. You search on Google 
						“How to start your business from scratch” and you will 
						get many useful articles. Entrepreneurship requires no 
						prerequisite so if you have planned to start your 
						business anytime in future then the right time is now. 
						To be on safer side you can do a technical or 
						certificate course related to your prospective business 
						to gain a theoretical understanding of what you are 
						going to do. Please note that you may not earn anything 
						in you first venture but the learnings will be 
						priceless. Wish you all the best.</p>

						aptitude. Alternatively, you can choose any career 
						options and work hard and enjoy your work to be 
						successful. If you can’t get bored of doing anything, 
						then you can succeed in any field. If you can work for 
						24 hours a day and seven days a week without any 
						expectations in return and feel happy about it, that is 
						the best career option for you.</p>
