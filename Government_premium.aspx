                        target="_blank">personality is important</a> if you want to succeed in your 
                    career. So to develop personality you have to start from now on.</p>
                <h3 class="style8">
                    <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Environment</strong></h3>
                <p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In college, there is an encouraging 
                    environment if you want to learn something new. There are friends, seniors and 
                    professors who are ready to help you all the time.After coming out from college, 
                    you would not find that type of encouraging environment.</p>
                <h3 class="style8">
                    <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What You Have to Prepare</strong></h3>
                <p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before I tell you how to prepare for 
                    government jobs while you are in college, first you have to know what actually 
                    you have to prepare.Well! Mark these words, to get a sarkari naukri you need to 
                    have a great personality along with academics.You have to do well in academics 
                    but you will never get a top class government job unless you have good 
                    personality.So work on both aspects: Academics as well as persona.</p>
                <h3 class="style8">
                    <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Academics</strong></h3>
                <p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Always give importance to your studies. 
                    It does not matter from which discipline you come from. Whether it is 
                    engineering, B.Com. Arts, or any other degree, try to score distinction, above 
                    60% in your studies.Take every semester seriously, do not leave anything for 
                    next semester. To get any type of good job, not just government job, your 
                    performance have to be good in academia.</p>
                <h3 class="style8">
                    <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Personality</strong></h3>
                <p>
                    Well! As I said earlier in this article, personality is not something that you 
                    get overnight but you have to develop in years.Again mark my words, a candidate 
                    for a job who is not good in academics but has a great personality is better 
                    than a candidate who is excellent in academics but with no 
                    personality.Personality is a huge area and i cannot cover in just one or two 
                    paragraphs. So, you can read more about
