							make a decision about your career. A concrete plan 
							about your future needs to be drawn at this 
							juncture, which will in turn determine the course of 
							your professional life.<br />
							<br />
							Stiff competition and plenty of options can often 
							leave students confused and discouraged. To weed out 
							the thorns of confusion, you first need to analyze 
							your interests, hobbies, inclination, potentiality 
							and opportunities. It is often said that if you 
							choose your career based on your interest and hobby, 
							the success rate as well as satisfaction level will 
							be very high. If you do what you love, you will 
							never need to &quot;work&quot; a single day in your life. Do 
							not choose courses after 12th -under the influence 
							of friends or parents. Give priority to your 
							potential and interest. It should be the sole 
							criteria for selecting a career.</span></p>
							<p align="justify"></p>
							<p align="justify" class="style6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Choose your career on the 
							basis of the following aspects:<br />
							<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
							•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Area of interest<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
							•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Personality<br />

							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
							In the coming years, a majority (85%) of the jobs 
							will require people with some education and 
							training. So it is advisable that you go for 
							specialized education rather than sticking to just 
							basic degrees. A little training or practical 
							education would be a shot in the arm.<br />
							<br />
							</p>
							<p align="justify" class="style6">&nbsp;Here are a few popular professional courses after 
							12th you may seek:</p>
							<h2 align="justify">&nbsp;</h2>
							<h2 align="justify"><span style="color: #f04923;">

							<p align="justify" class="style6">Jobs in management are highly 
							sought after because they are rewarding and 
							fulfilling in the long run. People who put in the 
							required effort are likely to see growth and success 
							considerably sooner. That combined with recognition 
							and a handsome salary make the management stream a 
							hot career choice for young individuals across the 
							country.<br />
							<br />
							After class 12, students can opt for management 
							courses at bachelor level such as Bachelor of 
							Business Administration (BBA), Bachelor of Business 
							Studies (BBS), Bachelor of Business Studies (BBS) 
							and Bachelor of Financial and Investment Analysis 
							(BFIA). <br />
							<br />
							The fields of work involved cover a wide range of 
							skills and requirements, so every aspirant can hope 
							to find a place to fit into. These fields include 
							HR, Finance, Operations, Marketing, and Information 
							Systems. Under these broad categories, we can also 
							speak of:</p>
							<ul>

							</ul>
							<h2 align="justify" class="style10">Computers &amp; IT stream </h2>
							<p align="justify" class="style6">Of late, computers have become an 
							integral part of our daily lives. From schools to 
							workplaces, they have claimed a dominant position 
							because of their many useful functions. Computers 
							allow people with disabilities to lead a normal life 
							and enable them to work from home. <br />
							<br />
							So if the field of computers and information 
							technology interests you, then you can opt for 
							computers as your career destination after your 12th 
							class. There are a lot of career options in this 
							field ranging from data entry operator to software 
							engineer, from web designing to web developing and 
							so on.<br />

							<p align="justify" class="style6">Engineering is one of the most

							and Mathematics opt for engineering as their career 
							option.The field combines math, science and 
							creativity to either solve problems or develop 
							products.<br />
							<br />
							So if you have already decided to go for 
							engineering, you need to have a good command over 
							mathematics, physics and chemistry as these are the 
							prerequisites to get into a good engineering 
							college. Apart from that you need to secure 60% 
							marks in 10+2 to get into the elite IITs. But if you 
							have not secured 60% marks in intermediate 
							examination, then you need not to worry because we 
							have several options other than IITs.<br />
							<br />
							Students need to qualify engineering entrance exams 
							like

							if you have decided to get into a medical college 
							you need to appear for an entrance exam conducted by 
							several regulatory bodies including CBSE. Starting 
							in 2013, the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test 
							for Under Graduate courses (<a title="All about NEET" href="http://www.indiaeducation.net/neet-ug/" class="style11">NEET-UG</a>) 
							will be conducted at an all India level aims to 
							relieve the need of students to appear in multiple 
							tests and promote merit in admission process. NEET 
							UG will allow class XII students to sit in a single 
							entrance examination to get admission to the MBBS 
							course in almost all medical colleges in India, 
							including private medical colleges.<br />
							<br />
							Medical entrance examinations are also conducted by

							<a class="style11">
							Vocational Education</a> training (VET) institutes

							<br />
							The best part of the institute is that working 
							students can join the course, and even select the 
							timings as per their convenience. The vocational 
							institutes allow the students to study online and 
							attend either evening or morning classes. Moreover, 
							financial aid is provided to students who are 
							economically weak. Paying for education can be 
							unaffordable for many, especially with skyrocketing 
							primary education fees. Vocational education is 
							their best alternative. There was a time when

							programs. This attitude is changing now. <br />
							<br />
							The faculties of these Vocational education training 
							institutes are highly experienced. They impart 
							practical knowledge to their students. As a result 
							the students are able to have real life and

							with stipend – all of which can motivate excellence.<br />
							<br />
							Every state has vocational institutes where the

							become part of a specialized workforce. The 
							vocational courses offered can range from culinary 
							arts, bar tending, becoming a massage expert, 
							cooking to graphic designing, pottery, dyeing, 
							nursing, business administration, restaurant,
